                    Transcontinental Interactive (formerly Vortex Mobile) is a digital marketing agency focused on creating rich, diverse content for the mobile and social web.  They have worked with clients such as Malibu Rum, Canada Dry, Dr. Pepper, and Sobeys to create marketing websites and campaigns.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Developed numerous professional marketing sites and campaigns for major clients such as Malibu Rum and Sobeys using HTML/CSS, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and ASP.NET MVC 2 &amp; 3 using C#
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Implemented PIN-based contest websites for Canada Dry and Dr. Pepper. The websites used a combination of Flash (developed externally) and an HTML interface based on the Fancybox jQuery plugin.  The sites ran on a C# contest engine developed internally.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Developed a mobile site for Sobeys to promote three new test pilot stores opening in southern Ontario. As one of two front-end developers on the project, I implemented the flexible layout used to properly size the site across mobile devices as well as most of the rest of the front-end. In addition, I developed C# and MS SQL based sorting functionality for a Departments section which contained multiple articles for each department.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Worked on the front-end of a blog-based promotion for a Malibu Rum Summer Concert Tour campaign.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Created multiple demos using jQuery Mobile
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Wedding planner demo created entirely by me as an initial exploration of jQuery Mobile's feature set. The demo featured a guest list, a vendor list, and a budget, all with basic CRUD functionality developed using C# with an MS SQL database.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Government demo to demonstrate an iPad based interface to be used for quickly entering government forms.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gained valuable experience and developed best practices for developing on the mobile web through the development of multiple mobile websites and through participation in the mobile design and development process, as well as working with user experience designers.
